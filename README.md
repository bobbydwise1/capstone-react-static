Name of Student:  Robert Lee



Name of Project:  Chess Variant: Tamerlame Chess 2000



Project’s Purpose or Goal: This is a game that is a spin-off of chess.  This version of chess will use a bigger game board (bigger than 8x8), and will have more chess pieces that are different than the traditional chess pieces.



List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:



-There will be a game board of no bigger than 13x13, with a set of black game pieces and white game pieces.

-There will at least be all the traditional chess piece graphics of pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king.

-When any piece is dragged anywhere else on the gameboard, it will erase any piece in the square, and then the piece will be moved there (ex: there is no checking the player if their moves are “legal” for that piece.).

-There are no “turns”.  Ex, it is possible for white or black to move 10 pieces in a row if they wanted.

-A captured pieces component.



What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

-React

-Redux

-Atom

-Node.js

-Babel

-math.js javascript library

-p5 javascript library?

-Possibly use the Angular framework?



If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

-Add turns, white only moves one piece, then black moves one piece… etc.

-Add game piece move checking to only allow pieces to move to a “legal” square.

-Add a skinning feature to change the look of the game.

-Refactor for React Native.

-Refactor for responsive UI.

-Add a scripted interface (to set up the next feature.)

-Add 1 vs CPU mode, with the AI using a technique called alpha-beta pruning.

-Add user login accounts?

-Add backend for firebase.

-Add chat feature.



What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

-React Native



Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?

-Possible refactor for Android.
